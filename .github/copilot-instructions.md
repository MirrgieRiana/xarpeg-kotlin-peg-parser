# Instructions for GitHub Copilot

- In issues, communicate in the same natural language as the initial message.
- In pull requests, communicate in the same natural language as the "Original prompt" written in the initial message, if it is not provided, or the title.
- When launching the Agent from GitHub to create a pull request, initialize the pull request title and initial comment in the same natural language as user's.
- The `./gradlew check` task fails here when Kotlin/Native tries to download toolchains; use `./gradlew jvmTest` instead for test verification.
